# jeremyfrank's dotfiles

My dotfiles. Borrow as you see fit.

## Setup

`rake install`

This will setup the following:

* oh-my-zsh
* dotfiles

This auto installs oh-my-zsh, set the shell to use zsh, and creates symlinks in `~/` that point to the appropriate files in `~/.dotfiles`, where everything is configured and tweaked.

## Credits

Most of this is inspired from dotfile repos from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles), with additional items from varoious other sources.
